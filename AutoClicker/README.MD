OH BOY I FINALLLY DID SOMETHING
kinda.
i just stole some code lol.
proceduralized it (aka, i dont like object oriented programming, 
thus translated OOP -> ...kinda procedural. 
Atleast, something i can understand enough to manipulate lol.)
and added a few features.

The important part ironically is the adding a few features, as that was the whole point lol.
...Albiet, i havent yet added anything and have probably broke it twice over :/
So, because i won't remember otherwise, this is a list of intended features

```
*~ 1 = AutoClicker. It clickers for you.

*~ 2 = Config file!!! This way we can write down dev- i mean details :P
This way, the user can personalize what buttons, and likely how it works,
but more on that in the next lines

*~ 3 = Multiclicker. It clickers EVERYWHERE for you.
...What i mean, is you can select multiple locations.
Ideally i want to actually... Disconnect the cursor and mouse click, (and you know, making this like making a new mouse for the OS... AAAAAA)
Because that way i... uh, actually can click multiple locations at once.

Think if i dont manage to make a new OS mouse, i will have it rapidly click between the locations. (Round robin -- Communistic Clicks. lol.)

*~ 4 = CMD prompt cmds. We're allready in console, so why not?? Sides, if other ideas go to plan, a CUI will be needed... atleast.
I dont have the technically prowess to make a gui. it hurts.

(Its probably only due to OOP, but i digress XD)

```

For now this will do, and will keep me from going insane.
